## Development

In this repository, both frontend and backend are combined into a single NextJS project. In the beginning a quick look into the [docs](https://nextjs.org) may be useful.

To start developing make sure you complete the following steps.

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and make sure the commands `npm` and `node` work globally
2. Within this project install dependencies with the command: `npm install`
3. Run the development server with the command `npm run dev`
